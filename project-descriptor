    - Investigating how to use wnd b nd deploy to HEC and other work stations.
    - The goals here are to replicate a paper, testing how PGN noise can affect training of CLIP in attack environments
    - when this has been shown, we'll improve the code to enclude a decoder, which will attempt to rebuild images from the CLIP embeddings
